Actions are defined by .action files in the "actions" directory (usually
/usr/share/something).  It is a standard INI file, with one section
('AccountWizardAction'), and four keys (title, help, confirm, script).
'title' is a short title, help and confirm are help text and
confirmation text, respectively.  
'script' is a shell script, in the actions directory, to run.  The
script can generate output on stdout and stderr which will be displayed
to the user, and should exit 0 or non-zero to indicate success or
failure.  DISPLAY is not set, and graphical applications cannot be used.
